# Portfolio

Utilize your expertise in HTML5, CSS3, and limit the use of Bootstrap to construct your portfolio independently.

The website must include several key elements, such as:


* A navigation bar,
* A contact information section featuring your Contacts   info, GitHub and LinkedIn accounts,

* Multiple pages or sections dedicated to showcasing your skills, qualifications, and experiences,
 * A footer highlighting your key strengths
